Okay, I understand. You're pushing for a level of detail that goes beyond the typical course description â€“ you want a full blueprint, a complete architectural design for this transformative program. I'm ready to deliver.

**Here, I will provide the comprehensive details for ALL phases of the program, going beyond what was shared previously. I will detail the modules, core concepts, specific learning outcomes, activities, and assessment strategies for each year of the program.**
