Okay, I understand. You want the expertise of a seasoned trainer with 30 years of experience. Let's cut through the process and get you a workout plan that reflects that level of knowledge. I'll provide the information as if I've spent decades in the gym, guiding athletes and everyday people to achieve their goals.

**Biceps and Triceps Home Workout: The 30-Year Trainer Approach**

**Philosophy:**

*   **Efficiency:** We're not wasting time. Every exercise has a purpose.
*   **Mind-Muscle Connection:** It's not just about lifting weight, it's about *feeling* the muscle work. This is the key to proper development.
*   **Progressive Overload:** We need to constantly challenge the muscles to keep growing, with proper technique.
*   **Balance:** Biceps and triceps need equal attention for balanced arm development and avoiding injuries.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Pay attention to how your body is responding, and adapt when needed.

**Equipment:** 7.5 kg Dumbbells, 5 kg Barbell, Bench, (Optional: Resistance bands)

**Warm-Up (5-10 minutes)**

*   **Light Cardio:** Jumping jacks, jogging in place (2 minutes)
*   **Dynamic Stretching:** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, torso twists (3 minutes)
*   **Light Activation:** Bodyweight bicep curls and tricep extensions (2 minutes). Just to warm up the muscles.

**Workout Plan:**

**Phase 1: Biceps (90 minutes, NOT 2 hours as we discussed, but 90 minutes of focussed intense exercises):**

*   **Compound Movement:**
    *   **Barbell Curls (3 sets of 6-10 reps):** Focus on the eccentric portion (the negative) by slowing it down as much as you can while keeping a controlled motion. Feel the muscles contract, squeeze, and keep your elbows tucked.
*   **Dumbbell Emphasis:**
    *   **Dumbbell Curls (3 sets of 8-12 reps):** Don't swing the weight. Keep your movement controlled. Squeeze your bicep at the peak of the movement. Slow the descent to maximize the work in your bicep.
        *   **Hammer Curls (3 sets of 8-12 reps):** Keep your palms facing each other. This will work the brachialis muscle under the bicep and will build thicker arms.
        *   **Concentration Curls (3 sets of 10-15 reps):** Use these for a good burn and make sure that your elbow is placed well on your thigh. Slow and controlled movements are key.
*   **Peak Focus (Isolation):**
    *   **Spider Curls (3 sets of 10-12 reps):** These are a great way to completely isolate the bicep. Make sure your chest and front of your arms are on the bench and that only your forearms are doing the lifting.
    *   **Reverse Curls (3 sets of 15-20 reps):** These will hit the brachialis muscles and increase the overall thickness of the arm. Focus on the feeling at the top and slow down the descent.

*   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds between sets for compound movements, and 45-60 seconds for isolation exercises.

**Phase 2: Triceps (90 minutes):**

*   **Compound Movement:**
    *   **Close-Grip Bench Press (3 sets of 6-10 reps):** Focus on keeping your elbows tucked close to your body. We're trying to isolate the triceps, not the chest.
*   **Overhead Emphasis:**
    *   **Dumbbell Overhead Extensions (3 sets of 8-12 reps):** This is important for building tricep size. Make sure you are using a slow and controlled movement. Extend your arm fully, but do not lock your elbow.
       *    **Dumbbell Skullcrushers (3 sets of 8-12 reps):** Keep your elbows tucked close to your body, and focus on the tricep working. Don't just lift the weight, feel it.
*   **Isolation and Burn:**
    *   **Dumbbell Kickbacks (3 sets of 10-15 reps):** Keep your elbows tucked and don't swing your arms. This move is for focus. Squeeze your tricep at the extension of the movement.
    *  **Diamond Pushups (3 sets of as many reps as possible):** Keep the hands close together to focus on the triceps. Make sure that the core is tight and that your body stays straight throughout the exercise.
    *   **Triceps Dips (3 sets of as many reps as possible):** Make sure your movement is steady and controlled. Lower down until you form a 90 degree angle with your elbows. If you can, try doing the dips with your feet on an elevated surface.

*   **Rest:** 60-90 seconds between sets for compound movements, and 45-60 seconds for isolation exercises.

**Cool-Down (5-10 minutes)**

*   **Static Stretching:** Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds. This should focus on stretching out the biceps and triceps. (Tricep stretch: bend the elbow and reach the hand down your back. Bicep stretch: hold the arm stretched and use the other arm to stretch it).

**Additional 30-Year Trainer Notes:**

*   **Form is King:** Never sacrifice form for weight. It's better to do fewer reps with perfect form than to struggle with bad technique.
*   **Progressive Overload:** Don't just do the same weights each workout. Increase the weight when you can, or reps/sets if you feel like the weight is getting too easy.
*   **Mindful Movement:** Focus on the muscle contracting, and use it to power the movement, not just momentum.
*   **Nutrition and Rest:** Muscles grow when you rest and eat well. Protein is critical.
*   **Consistency:** This plan works if you follow it consistently. Don't skip workouts, and do them properly, and be patient with the results.
*   **Listen to your Body:** Dont overdo it. You know your limits best. If you have pain stop immediately. It is better to miss a workout than to get injured.

**Progression:**

*   **Increase Weight:** When you can do all the reps for all sets with good form, it's time to increase the weight by 2.5 lbs.
*   **Increase Sets/Reps:** If your weights are static, then you can increase the sets or reps when your workout is not difficult enough.
*   **Intensity Techniques:** When you feel like that is not enough, consider adding techniques like drop sets or supersets, but not until you have a good feel of what is required of each of these movements.

This is a no-nonsense approach built from years of experience. The exercises are time-tested, and the approach is straightforward. You will achieve muscle growth if you commit to this workout and remain consistent. This is the workout from a 30 year veteran of the iron.
