We will also highlight key mathematical concepts used in this field. This chapter will lay a rigorous and complete foundation for the more complex and exciting topics ahead.

### 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence?

*   **Definition:**
    *   Artificial intelligence (AI) is the broad concept of creating machines capable of intelligent behavior that mimics human cognitive functions. This includes a range of techniques that enable machines to perform tasks such as:
        *   **Perception**: Interpreting sensory data (e.g., images, sounds, text).
         *   **Learning**: Acquiring knowledge and refining existing skills through experience.
        *   **Reasoning**: Applying logic to derive new information or solve problems.
       *   **Acting:** Interacting with the environment in an intelligent manner.
    *   The overarching goal is to simulate human-like intellectual capabilities through computers.

*   **Types of AI:**
    *   **Narrow AI (or Weak AI):**
         *   This is AI designed and trained for a specific task, optimizing for performance within a narrowly defined domain.
        *   Examples include:
                *   Image classification systems (trained to recognize objects).
               *   Voice recognition systems (trained to transcribe human speech).
               *   Spam filtering algorithms (trained to detect unsolicited messages).
              * AI chess games and other games.
        *  While they excel at their tasks, they lack general intelligence, having no capability outside the problem they were designed to solve. They are not capable of independent thought or creativity.
    *   **General AI (or Strong AI):**
        *   This is a hypothetical AI that possesses human-level intelligence. Such an AI would be capable of:
              *   Understanding any intellectual task that a human can perform.
            *   Learning new information and skills in a flexible and generalizable manner, not just in a pre-defined task.
          *   Adapting to unforeseen circumstances, and engaging with their environment using a human-like level of intelligence and flexibility.
        *   General AI does not yet exist.
     *   **Super AI:**
        *   This is a hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in every conceivable way, surpassing human intellectual capabilities in creativity, general knowledge, and problem solving.
       *  It is also often discussed in science fiction, but not within a framework of scientific and technical viability.

*   **Historical Overview:**
    *   The field of AI began with **symbolic reasoning (logic-based AI)** in the 1950s:
         *   Aims to encode human knowledge into computers through formal logic, rules, and reasoning systems.
        *   First successes in solving well-defined mathematical and symbolic problems.
        *    Limitations in handling real-world uncertainty and complex knowledge representations.
       *   Key examples: early expert systems such as IBM's "Deep Blue" chess playing computer.
    *  **Machine learning emerged as a subfield:**
         *  Focusing on algorithms that could learn from data, without the need for explicit programming or rules.
         *   Emphasis on statistical models, pattern recognition and optimization techniques.
          *  Key early algorithms included Linear and Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), K-means clustering and Decision Trees.
          *  Limitations in complex problems and non-linear feature space.
   *   The 1980s and early 1990s saw a **revival of neural networks** based on biological neural networks:
        *  Based on the idea of an artificial neuron, which tried to mimic the structure of neurons in animal brains.
         *   Exploration of different architectures and algorithms such as multi-layer perceptrons, and backpropagation.
           * Limitations in training deep networks with limited computational power.
    *   **Deep learning** began around 2010, with the introduction of modern deep learning algorithms and architectures:
       *  Use of very deep architectures with multiple hidden layers.
         *  Use of large datasets for better performance.
         *  Introduction of powerful optimization techniques and new activation functions.
         * Resulted in large advancements in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

*   **Examples:**
    *   A rule-based system for playing chess: all rules are explicitly defined in the program, allowing it to make moves based on programmed logic.
    *  A machine learning model to identify spam in emails: learns patterns from training data to make predictions for new incoming emails.

### 1.2 The Relationship between AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)

*   **Definition of ML:**
    *   Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that utilizes algorithms to enable computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
    *   The key goal of ML is to create systems that can learn, adapt, and improve from experience automatically, allowing for robust and flexible decision-making models.
    *   ML systems are trained on data and can extract statistical relationships, patterns, and features directly from that data.
    *  ML models have the capability to make predictions, classify instances, generate new data, and learn different representations from data.
    *   **Types of ML:**
        *   **Supervised learning**: Learning from labeled data, where the input features and corresponding outputs (labels) are provided during training.
            *  Examples:
                *   Regression problems (predicting a continuous output variable like house price based on features).
                *   Classification problems (predicting a categorical output variable like image classification or spam detection).
       *   **Unsupervised learning**: Learning from unlabeled data, where the system has to automatically discover patterns or structure from unlabeled datasets without any target variable.
           * Examples:
                 *  Clustering algorithms, that identify distinct clusters of data points based on their features.
                * Dimensionality reduction techniques, used to represent data in a lower dimensional space, while keeping the most important patterns.
       *   **Reinforcement learning**: Learning through interactions with an environment, where the system (called the agent) learns to perform actions to maximize rewards or minimize punishments.
           * Examples: Learning to play games, robotics, autonomous agents
     *   **Core Components of ML:**
        *   **Data**: Data is the core component of any ML system; usually the training dataset is used to train the models, and test data is used to evaluate the trained models.
        *   **Algorithms**: The specific techniques (such as Linear Regression, or K-Means or Reinforcement learning algorithms) used by the ML system for learning from data.
        *   **Models**: The output of the training process. The result of what the ML algorithms learn from the data. Models are representations of learnt patterns and relationships.

    *   **Examples:**
        *   Linear regression to predict house prices: a supervised learning algorithm that learns from historical data of house prices and corresponding house features and predicts the price for new unseen data based on learnt relationships from the data.
        *   K-Means clustering for grouping similar data points: an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points together, revealing the inherent structure in unlabeled data.
        *   A reinforcement learning agent for playing a video game: an agent learns to play the video game by taking actions and observing the rewards and punishments given by the game environment.

*   **Definition of DL:**
    *   Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of Machine Learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks).
     * DL techniques allow machines to automatically learn complex features and representations directly from raw data.
    *   Deep Learning models are capable of capturing complex non-linear relationships between the input data and target variable.
    *  DL greatly reduces the need for explicit feature engineering, which traditionally needs a lot of domain expertise. DL models learn features automatically.

    *   **Core concepts of DL**:
        *   **Neural networks**: Composed of artificial neurons or units organized in layers, and are inspired from biological neural networks.
        *   **Activation functions:** Mathematical functions used by neurons to introduce non-linearity to model complex data. (examples include Relu, Sigmoid, Tanh).
        *   **Backpropagation:** Algorithm for computing gradients in neural networks, used to update weights and parameters for improved performance.
        *  **Optimization**: Gradient based optimization techniques to minimize the loss functions and train the models, like stochastic gradient descent.
    *   **Deep Neural network architectures:**
           *  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image and spatial data processing, which have convolutional layers to learn spatial patterns and pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
           *   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data processing, where neurons have internal states allowing them to process sequential data such as text, speech, and time series data.
          *    Transformers: Attention-based networks for sequential data processing. They use attention mechanisms to learn relationships between words in a sentence, enabling parallel processing of data and more efficient training compared to RNNs
*   **Examples:**
           *    CNNs for image recognition: layers learn spatial patterns from images automatically and classify them based on these learnt features.
           *    RNNs for natural language processing: layers process sentences or paragraphs sequentially and predict the next word based on the learnt context.
           *  Transformers for language and other tasks: layers learn attention based relationships within the data for translation, summarization, and other tasks.
     *  **Relationship between AI, ML and DL:**
            *  AI is the overarching field that encompasses ML and DL: Artificial intelligence is the broadest field aiming for general intelligence, encompassing all types of models and algorithms.
             * ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data: ML algorithms use data to improve performance and build models, automatically without explicitly programming every step.
             *  DL is a subset of ML that utilizes deep neural networks: DL models use multi-layered neural networks to automatically extract complex features from data.

### 1.3 Introduction to Generative AI

*  **Definition:**
        * Generative AI is a subfield of Machine Learning that focuses on creating new content or data samples that are similar to the training data.
      *   The core difference between generative and discriminative AI is that discriminative models map inputs to outputs, whereas generative models learn a probability distribution from which novel data samples can be generated.
    *  **Contrast with Discriminative AI:**
        *  Discriminative models are trained to classify data or predict outcomes using the relationship between input data and labels. They learn to distinguish between categories in the data.
       *  Generative models are trained to understand and learn the underlying distribution of the training data, such that new data can be generated from this distribution.
        * Examples:
            *   Discriminative Model: A model trained to classify images as either cat or dog.
          *   Generative Model: A model that generates novel images of cats or dogs.
    *   **Types of generative models:**
        *   Autoencoders (AEs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Used for data compression, representation learning and data generation.
        *  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Use a competitive setup to learn to generate realistic samples.
