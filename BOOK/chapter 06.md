     * Other platforms also include  IBM Cloud, and others that have similar capabilities.

### 6.4 Workflow

*    **General Steps:** A typical machine learning project follows these steps:
        *   **Data Preparation:** Data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation of data.
             * The data is prepared in a way to be suitable for the chosen machine learning model, and steps include normalization, standardization, feature engineering, and data augmentation.
        *  **Model Selection:** Selecting an appropriate generative model for the specific task at hand, considering the input data and desired outputs, and other factors including complexity of the model, and availability of pretrained weights.
         * The selection also involves selecting the specific architecture of the generative model based on the specific task at hand.
        *   **Training:** Training the model on the prepared dataset using the chosen optimization algorithm.
             * This includes backpropagation and gradient descent for updating model parameters.
        *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters (hyperparameters) for best performance on the given task.
         * This involves techniques such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
         *  Careful evaluation of model performance on a validation dataset.
        *  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality of the generated data by using both automated metrics and human evaluations.
             * This involves comparing the generated data to the real data using metrics such as FID or IS, and performing user studies for subjective analysis of the quality of generated data.
       *   **Deployment:** Deploying the trained model to a production environment for use by end users.
            *   This may include deploying the models as APIs, web apps or other types of applications, and requires careful testing, monitoring, and maintenance.
* **Key Points to Keep in Mind**:
    *   The above workflow can be implemented either using the high-level APIs or using the low level APIs of Tensorflow or Pytorch.
    *  It is essential to perform data preparation and pre-processing to ensure optimal model performance.
     * It is important to follow a structured approach by building a pipeline for data preparation, and modularizing your code, for easier experimentation, maintenance and deployment.
     *  Hyperparameter tuning is essential for finding optimal settings for your training process.

*  **Activities:**
    *  Implement a full training pipeline for a text-to-image model from data ingestion to model training, and evaluation, to deployment.
     *    Explore model serving techniques to deploy trained generative AI models on the cloud.
     *  Implement various data loading, preprocessing, model optimization, and deployment techniques.
