# Part I: Foundations and Core Concepts

## Chapter 2: Core Generative Models – Deep Dive

**Introduction:** This chapter provides a rigorous and in-depth examination of several core generative models. We will move beyond the basic principles covered in Chapter 1 and dive deep into the architectures, training mechanisms, mathematical underpinnings, and practical aspects of Autoencoders (AEs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Flow-Based Models, Transformers, and Diffusion Models. This chapter will provide you with a solid foundation for understanding and applying these models effectively.

### 2.1 Autoencoders (AEs)

*   **Concept:**
    *   Autoencoders (AEs) are a type of artificial neural network designed to learn a compressed representation (encoding) of input data and then to reconstruct the original input data as accurately as possible from this compressed representation (decoding).
    *   This process is achieved by passing the input through an **encoder** network that transforms the input into a lower-dimensional **latent space**, then passing the latent space through a **decoder** network which attempts to reconstruct the original data as close as possible.
    *   The latent space representation is a distilled version of the original input, capturing the most salient features and patterns in the input data, while discarding redundant or irrelevant information.
     *   Autoencoders are generally considered unsupervised learning techniques, because they are trained without explicit labels and learn features and representations implicitly from the input data.
*   **Structure:**
     *   **Encoder:** The encoder network transforms the input data (x) into a lower dimensional latent space representation (z), often represented by a vector. The encoder is a neural network composed of several fully connected or convolutional layers.
        *   *Example:* if the input image x has 784 features (for example a flattened 28x28 pixel image), the latent representation could be a vector with much lower dimensions such as 300 (z ∈ R300).
     *   **Latent Space:** The reduced dimensional space where the compressed representation lies.
         * A smaller latent space enforces stronger data compression and captures only the most significant patterns in the input data.
        *   A larger latent space maintains more information about the input data.
     *   **Decoder:** The decoder network takes the latent space representation (z) as input and attempts to reconstruct the original input data, often noted as x̃. The decoder is also a neural network composed of fully connected or deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) layers.
*   **Training Process:**
    *   The training process aims to minimize the reconstruction error, which is the difference between the original input data (x) and the reconstructed output (x̃).
       *  The data is passed through the encoder and decoder, and the decoder’s output is compared to the original input data using a cost or loss function.
    *   **Loss Functions:**
        *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The mean of the squared differences between the original input and the reconstructed output (typically for regression problems or when data is continuous). It is defined as:
             ```
              MSE = 1/m * Σ (xi - x̃i)²
             ```
               * where m is the number of samples, xi is the input data and x̃i is the reconstruction of the input data.
        *   **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Used when the input is a probability distribution (typically for binary outputs or multi-class classifications). Used when the input data is composed of probabilities. It is defined as:
             ```
           Cross_Entropy = - 1/m Σ (xi log(x̃i) + (1- xi) log(1- x̃i))
            ```
              * where m is the number of samples, xi is the input data (as probabilities) and x̃i is the reconstruction (as probabilities).
     *  *Backpropagation* and *gradient descent* (as described in chapter 1) are used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network weights, and the weights are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, to minimize the loss function.
     *  Training is performed iteratively using mini-batches of data, in a similar way to other deep learning models.
*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
    *   VAEs build upon AEs, adding a probabilistic twist by learning a probability distribution over the latent space, instead of just learning an encoding of the input. This introduces a concept of uncertainty in the latent space.
    *   The encoder outputs parameters of a probability distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution), rather than a fixed latent vector.
      *   This allows the model to learn continuous and structured latent spaces, from which new data can be easily sampled.
    *   **Reparameterization Trick:**
          *  Key mathematical trick that allows gradients to be backpropagated through random sampling from the distribution, which allows the model to be trained end to end.
         *   Instead of randomly drawing the latent space sample directly from the distribution, a sample is generated by transformation with a random value.
         * Example: if we sample from a normal distribution, instead of sampling z ~ N(μ, σ), we reparameterize as z = μ + σ * ϵ where ϵ ~ N(0, 1). The backpropagation can be performed through the parameters μ and σ, since we are not sampling directly from a distribution.
     *  **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):**
          *   The loss function for VAEs is a sum of two terms; the reconstruction loss and the KL-divergence loss. The loss function is referred to as the evidence lower bound (ELBO).
         *  *Reconstruction Loss*: How well the decoder generates an output that matches the original input (e.g. MSE or cross-entropy).
          *  *KL-Divergence Loss*: Ensures that the encoded latent space distribution is similar to a standard distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
          * The combination of these two loss functions ensures that the latent space both encapsulates meaningful information, and that it has a useful structure.

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Denoising:**  Training autoencoders to learn clean data representations from noisy data, thereby removing the noise from the input data.
      *  They can be used to recover original images from images containing noise or artifacts.
     *   **Dimensionality reduction:** Reducing the number of features of a dataset while preserving the most important information by compressing it in a lower dimensional latent space.
        *   The latent space representation can then be used for visualization, further feature processing, or other tasks.
     * **Feature Extraction:** The latent space can be used as a representation of the input data for downstream machine learning tasks
     *  **Anomaly Detection**: Autoencoders are trained using normal data, and they will have a high reconstruction error when presented with abnormal or outlier inputs.
*   **Examples**:
    * Implement a denoising autoencoder to remove noise from images of handwritten digits.
    *  Develop a variational autoencoder to generate new images of cats.
    * Train an autoencoder on a dataset, and extract the latent space for visualization.

*   **Activities:**
    *  Implement various types of AEs and VAEs using a Deep Learning framework of your choice.
    *  Experiment with different latent space sizes and evaluate their impact on the quality of reconstructions.
    *   Experiment with VAE training, tuning the hyperparameters, and trying different probability distributions for the latent space.
    *  Use different types of loss functions such as MSE or cross-entropy to improve the performance of autoencoders.
    *  Use autoencoders for image denoising tasks and evaluate their performance with different noise levels.

### 2.2 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

*   **Concept:**
    *   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of generative models that use an adversarial setup to train two neural networks:
          *   A *generator* network learns to produce new data samples from random noise, which are similar to the training data.
          *   A *discriminator* network learns to distinguish between real training data samples and the fake data samples generated by the generator.
     * The generator and discriminator networks compete against each other during training, which leads to both networks improving iteratively, with the generator learning to produce increasingly realistic data, and the discriminator getting better at detecting the fake data.
*  **Structure:**
     *   **Generator:**
        *    Takes a random noise vector (z) as input from a simple distribution (e.g., a standard normal distribution) and outputs a data sample (x̃)
          *  The generator network consists of a neural network such as fully connected layers or transposed convolutional layers that map from a low dimensional latent space to the high dimensional data space.
    *  **Discriminator:**
           *  Takes an input (x), which is either a real data sample from the training data, or a fake sample from the generator. The discriminator network outputs a single value, representing the probability (between 0 and 1) that the input is real data.
            * The discriminator network consists of a neural network that typically has the form of a convolutional neural network, that classifies images as either real or fake.
*   **Training Process:**
        *  The training process involves a two-player game.
        *  The generator tries to create new fake data samples that can trick the discriminator into thinking that the fake samples are real.
         *  The discriminator improves itself to effectively recognize the fake images created by the generator.
    *  **Adversarial Loss:** The core objective is defined by an adversarial loss function.
          *  The generator’s loss is optimized to increase the probability of a fake sample being classified as real by the discriminator.
          *  The discriminator's loss is optimized to correctly classify the real and fake samples and output the correct probabilities.
      *   The training can be formulated as a minimax problem, with the discriminator trying to maximize the probability of recognizing real samples and penalizing itself if it is fooled by the generator, while the generator tries to minimize the discriminator's ability to discriminate between real and fake samples.
        *   *Nash Equilibrium*: The point at which neither the generator nor discriminator can improve further, represents a good solution for training GANs (although achieving it in practice is hard).
*  **GAN Training Challenges:**
         *  **Mode Collapse:** The generator starts producing only limited variation in outputs and is stuck to only generating a subset of the data distribution.
         *   **Training instability:** GANs are unstable and they can easily diverge during training. Careful hyperparameter optimization, and architecture design is often required to get good results.
        *   **Sensitive to Hyperparameter Selection:** The performance and stability of GANs are very sensitive to the values of various hyperparameters (learning rates, batch size, architecture, etc.) that often need to be tuned carefully.
*   **Variations:**
        *   **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs):** GANs that use convolutional layers for image generation. This leads to great improvements in visual quality of generated images.
        *   **Conditional GANs (CGANs):** GANs that allow for conditional generation, by adding additional information as inputs to the generator and discriminator, such as labels. This allows for generating targeted images or data based on certain constraints or conditions.
        *  **StyleGAN:** A particular type of GAN focusing on high-quality, detailed image generation by controlling different levels of detail in images using a special input mapping, as well as by performing operations at different scales.
          *  **Progressive GANs:** Enable the training of GANs to produce very high resolution images by incrementally growing the size and complexity of both the generator and the discriminator during training.
*   **Use Cases:**
     * **Image generation:** Generating realistic and diverse images for various applications (faces, nature, artwork).
       *  **Image editing:** Manipulation of images based on specific edits or stylistic transforms.
     *  **Super-resolution:** Enhance the resolution of low quality images.
       *   **Style transfer:** Applying the artistic style of one image to another.
      *    **Data Augmentation:** Creating realistic but artificially generated training samples to improve the performance of supervised learning models.
*  **Examples:**
        * Implement DCGANs for generating images of human faces, and handwritten digits.
        * Use StyleGAN for photorealistic face generation
        * Implement a cGAN for generating images conditioned on a label.
        *  Explore GANs for super-resolution of image data.

      * Experiment with different GAN architectures (DCGANs, CGANs, StyleGAN).
      * Explore techniques to address mode collapse in GANs.
       * Fine tune GANs to get high quality images by modifying hyperparameters.
         *  Experiment with various types of adversarial loss functions.

### 2.3 Flow-Based Generative Models

*   **Concept:**
    *   Flow-Based Models, also known as Normalizing Flows, use a series of invertible transformations (flows) that map a simple probability distribution (e.g., a Gaussian) to a complex data distribution.
      *   By transforming data through a sequence of carefully designed invertible functions, these models enable us to model and sample from complex distributions.
    *    The transformations must be invertible, meaning that we must be able to map data from the original space to the latent space, and back from the latent space to the original data space.
        *   *Invertible Transformations*: The use of invertible transforms enables exact computation of data likelihood, which is essential for training and makes flow based models very efficient to sample from.
*   **Key Aspects:**
     *  **Normalizing Flows:** Use a series of invertible and differentiable transformations, and are defined as a series of mappings:
         *   Given an input x and latent variable z, such that x = g(z) where g() is a mapping through all the invertible transformations. Since the transform is invertible, then z = g-1(x).
       * Transformations used in flow based models are designed in a way that the jacobian of the inverse transformation is easy to compute. This greatly speeds up the computations during training and evaluation.
        *  During training, the model learns the parameters of the flows, such that probability distribution of transformed data matches the training data distribution.
   *    **Likelihood Maximization:** Flow-based models are trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood (or maximizing the log likelihood) using techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This is a major difference between flow based models and GANs.
         *   This involves the computation of the log likelihood of data, which is possible due to the use of invertible transforms.
         *   As training progresses, flow based models learn to map data to a latent space that has a simple probability distribution, such as the Gaussian distribution, enabling easy sampling of new data.
     *   **Stable Training:** Due to the use of the likelihood maximization and the presence of well defined loss functions, flow based models have stable training, as opposed to GANs.
   *    **Efficient Sampling:** After training, sampling from flow-based models is generally very efficient due to the invertibility of the transforms and the simple nature of the latent space probability distribution.
*   **Use Cases:**
        *   **High-quality image generation:** Due to their ability to sample data efficiently, flow-based models are used for generating very high-quality images.
        *  **Probability Density Estimation**: Flow-based models are used to perform accurate probability density estimation for the learnt data distributions.
        *    **Data Modeling:** Flow based models can generate different forms of data that can be used as representations in various machine learning tasks.
*   **Key Examples:**
      *   **NICE (Non-linear Independent Component Estimation):** Introduced coupling layers for invertible transformations.
    *   **RealNVP (Real-valued Non-volume Preserving):** Improved NICE with invertible affine coupling layers.
   *     **Glow:** Uses 1x1 convolutions and affine coupling layers.
      *  **FFJORD (Free-form continuous flows using Ordinary Differential Equations):**  Uses Ordinary differential equations and continuous transformations for data generation.

*  **Activities:**
    *   Implement NICE, RealNVP or Glow architectures using a Deep Learning framework of your choice and explore the invertibility property of the transforms.
    *  Evaluate the generation quality and the log likelihood on standard image datasets
    *  Compare flow based models to other generative models.

### 2.4 Transformer Networks

*   **Concept:**
    *   Transformer networks are attention based architectures that can process sequential data such as text or time-series with high efficiency.
        *   Unlike RNNs that processes data sequentially, transformers can process data in parallel, reducing computation time.
        *   They rely on the attention mechanism which allows the network to directly focus on important parts of the input sequence while processing the data, allowing the model to learn relationships between various data points.
*   **Key Aspects:**
       *  **Attention Mechanism:**
         * Allows the network to attend to various other words or positions in the input, rather than focusing solely on the immediate context.
        *   **Self-Attention:** Allows the network to learn the relationships within the input sequence itself, and how each input is related to all the other inputs.
        *  **Multi-Head Attention:**  Extends the self-attention by learning multiple sets of attention weights, allowing the model to attend to various types of features at different scales.
     *   **Encoder-Decoder Structure:**
        *   Transformers can use both an encoder-decoder structure or just encoder only or decoder only structures.
         *   **Encoder:** Transforms the input sequence into a context vector, summarizing the input data for further processing.
            *  Encoder consists of multiple blocks where self attention, and feedforward operations are repeated.
         *   **Decoder:** Generates an output sequence based on the context vector produced by the encoder. It produces its output autoregressively.
            *   Decoder consists of multiple blocks with self-attention, feedforward and encoder-decoder attention.

*   **Use Cases:**
     *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
        *   Text generation (generating new text such as articles, summaries, or dialogues).
        *   Machine translation (converting text from one language to another).
        *   Text summarization (extracting the most important parts of a text document).
       *  Question Answering: Answering questions based on a given context.
     *   **Computer Vision:**
          * Image captioning: Generate descriptive text of an image.
         *  Object detection: Detect objects in an image and output the bounding boxes.
          * Image generation: Generate novel images by learning the data distribution of a set of training images.
*   **Key Examples:**
         *  **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** A decoder-only transformer trained for text generation, with multiple variants such as GPT-2, GPT-3 and GPT-4. They are used in different text based tasks, by fine-tuning the pretrained model with the specific task data.
        *   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** An encoder-only transformer used for language representation and different NLP tasks.
         *  **Vision Transformer (ViT):** A transformer based architecture that can be used for image classification and feature learning.
*   **Limitations:**
     *   **Computationally expensive:** Transformers require large computational resources due to the quadratic nature of the self-attention mechanism, and are harder to use in resource constrained devices.
      *   **Requires large datasets:** Transformer models perform better with large datasets since they rely on huge amount of data to effectively learn the attention weights.

*   **Examples:**
         *   Use a pretrained GPT model to generate a story.
        *   Train a transformer model for translating from English to French.
          * Explore the attention weights to learn the relationships between inputs and outputs.

*   **Activities:**
    *   Implement a self-attention mechanism from scratch to better understand the inner workings of a transformer.
    *  Fine-tune pre-trained transformer models for specific NLP tasks like summarization, or question answering.
      *  Train a transformer for machine translation.
      *  Explore the applications of Vision transformers in different vision tasks

### 2.5 Diffusion Models

*  **Concept:**
      * Diffusion models learn to reverse a gradual noising process to generate data, starting with pure random noise and gradually transforming it to resemble the training data.
       *  This is achieved by defining a gradual forward process and learning a reverse process.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Forward Diffusion:** Gradually adds Gaussian noise to data samples (x0) until they resemble pure noise (xT). Each step of the process is defined as a Markov chain (meaning that the next state depends only on the current state).
          *   The forward diffusion process follows a sequence of steps x0 -> x1 -> x2 ->... xT, until the data is transformed into a completely noisy state (xT).
         *   The amount of noise applied at each step is determined by a pre-defined *noise schedule*.
        *    **Reverse Diffusion:** Learns to gradually remove the noise from xT and recover a data sample x0 that is sampled from the data distribution.
           *   The reverse process follows a sequence of steps xT -> xT-1 -> xT-2 ->... x0, in which at each step the model attempts to denoise its inputs.
           *    Reverse diffusion process is guided by a model trained to predict the noise added to the data during forward diffusion.
*   **Key Aspects:**
        *  **Markov Chain:** Both the forward and reverse processes can be seen as markov chains, in which the state at each step depends only on the previous state.
        *   **Gaussian Noise:** Gaussian noise is commonly used as the noising function in forward process.
         *  **Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs):**  The reverse process uses a score function (the gradient of log-probability distribution), to gradually denoise the data.
    * **Use Cases:**
         *  **High-quality image generation:** Generates very detailed and high-resolution images from random noise.
         *   **Image editing:** Allows flexible image editing operations (such as inpainting, interpolation, etc.).
         *   **Audio generation:** Generate realistic audio signals.
*   **Types:**
         * **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM):** One of the earliest successful diffusion models, where data is gradually turned to noise in the forward process, and this noising process is reversed in the reverse process to generate data.
          *   DDPM utilizes Gaussian noise, and the reverse process is also a Gaussian distribution.
        *   **Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs):** These models try to learn the gradient of the probability density function (score function) of the data distribution which is then used in the reverse diffusion process.
*  **Pros:**
        *   **High-quality outputs:** Diffusion models generate very high quality data samples compared to other models.
        *  **Stable training:** Diffusion models are easier to train compared to GANs.
        *   **Diverse samples:** They also generate diverse samples covering the range of the data distribution, rather than getting stuck in modes of the distribution.
*   **Limitations:**
       *  **Slower sampling:** Sampling from diffusion models is typically slow, since the reverse diffusion process is an iterative process consisting of a large number of steps.

*   **Examples:**
         * Implement a DDPM to generate images of handwritten digits.
        *   Experiment with different types of noise schedules to observe their impact on image quality.
     *   Implement score based models, and explore their performance for image generation.
*   **Activities:**
      * Build a diffusion model from scratch using a deep learning framework
     *  Experiment with techniques for accelerating the sampling process such as DDIM.
        *  Implement diffusion models for tasks other than image generation.

* **Activities (end of chapter):**
    *   Implement the different models from scratch or by using pre-built libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow.
    *   Experiments comparing outputs of different models.
    *   Projects: Generating images or text using a chosen model.
