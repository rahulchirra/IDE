# Part I: Foundations and Core Concepts

## Chapter 2: Core Generative Models â€“ Deep Dive

**Introduction:**
In this chapter, we dive deep into the architectures and training mechanisms of several core generative models. We will build upon the concepts introduced in Chapter 1, and explore Autoencoders (AEs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Flow-Based Models, Transformers, and Diffusion models. You will gain an understanding of the underlying principles of each model and learn to implement them effectively.

### 2.1 Autoencoders (AEs)

*   **Concept:**
    *   Autoencoders are neural networks designed to learn a compressed representation (encoding) of input data and then try to reconstruct the original input from that representation. The aim of an AE is to learn a useful compact representation of the data.
    *   They achieve this by passing the input through an encoder network, which squeezes the data into a lower-dimensional latent space, then passing this compact representation to a decoder network, which reconstructs the original input data.
    *   The latent space represents the learned compact representation, which should be a distilled version of the original input data, capturing its most important features.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Encoder:** A neural network that takes input data and maps it to the latent space. It performs dimensionality reduction.
    *   **Latent Space:** The lower dimensional representation learned by the encoder
    *   **Decoder:** A neural network that takes the latent space representation and maps it back to the input data space.
*   **Training Process:**
    *   The training process involves feeding the network with the input, getting its output, comparing this to the original input, then updating the weights to minimize the reconstruction error.
    *   The error is measured using a cost function such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross Entropy loss, that measures the difference between the input and the reconstructed input.
    *   Backpropagation and gradient descent (as discussed in Chapter 1) are used to train the network.
*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
    * VAEs are a probabilistic upgrade to AEs, where the encoder outputs parameters to a probability distribution in the latent space, rather than a fixed point.
    *  *Reparameterization Trick:* Essential for backpropagation, as it allows gradients to be backpropagated through random sampling from a distribution by transforming the sample to be differentiable, rather than sampling it directly.
     *  *Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):* A loss function that combines reconstruction loss with a regularization term (KL-divergence) that forces the model to represent the distribution in latent space.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Denoising:** Training the autoencoder to reconstruct clean images from noisy images.
    *   **Dimensionality reduction:** Extracting the latent space as a compact representation of high-dimensional data.
    *  **Feature Extraction:** AEs can be used to extract robust features for other ML models.
     *  **Anomaly Detection:** By reconstructing instances with its learnt representations, an AE can detect outliers or anomalous samples that it has not seen before.

*   **Examples**:
    *  Implement various types of AEs and VAEs to generate images from MNIST and Fashion MNIST
    *  Implementation of a denoising AE
    *  Use a VAE to learn a latent space of different faces, and sample faces from that latent space

*   **Activities:**
    *   Implement an autoencoder from scratch using a Deep Learning framework, such as Tensorflow/Keras or PyTorch, and perform image reconstruction tasks.
    *   Explore different latent space sizes, evaluate their impact on the quality of the reconstructions.
    *  Tune the hyper parameters and evaluate the performance of the VAEs.

### 2.2 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

*   **Concept:**
     * GANs consist of two neural networks, a *generator* and a *discriminator*, competing against each other in a game-theoretic manner.
    *   The *generator* network learns to produce new data samples that are similar to the training data, starting from random noise.
    *   The *discriminator* network learns to distinguish between real training data and fake data generated by the generator.
    *   Through this adversarial process, both the generator and the discriminator are continually improved: the generator learns to create increasingly realistic data samples, and the discriminator gets better at detecting fake data.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Generator:** Takes a random noise vector as input and outputs a data sample (e.g., an image).
    *   **Discriminator:** Takes an input (either a real data sample or a fake sample created by the generator) and outputs the probability that the input is real data.
*   **Training Process:**
    *   The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously.
    *   The generator tries to "fool" the discriminator by producing increasingly realistic data samples, trying to make them be indistinguishable from the real data.
    *   The discriminator tries to get better at distinguishing between real and fake samples by being able to recognize the fake samples generated by the generator.
     * This adversarial process makes both the discriminator and generator get better at each training step.
     *  *Adversarial Loss*: Used to train both networks; this encourages the generator to produce realistic samples, while encouraging the discriminator to effectively identify the fake samples.
*   **GAN Training Challenges:**
    *  **Mode Collapse:** Generator learns to produce only limited variation in the output, such that the discriminator can not learn to identify all types of samples.
   *  **Training instability:** GAN training can be notoriously unstable. GAN parameters need to be tuned carefully and the architectures needs to be designed in order to get good results.
    *   **Sensitive to Hyperparameter Selection:** GANs are often sensitive to the values of hyperparameters.
*   **Variations:**
    *   **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs):** Uses convolutional layers for image generation.
    *   **Conditional GANs (CGANs):** Allows for conditional generation based on class labels or other information.
    *   **StyleGAN:** Focus on high-quality, detailed image generation by controlling different levels of detail in images.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *  **Image generation:** Creating realistic images of faces, nature, or other objects.
    *  **Image editing:** Altering image attributes such as color, background, or style.
    *   **Super-resolution:** Upscaling low resolution images to a higher resolution.
    *   **Style transfer:** Transferring the style of one image to another.
    *  **Data Augmentation:** Producing additional training data for other ML models.
*  **Examples:**
        *   Implement DCGANs for image generation from MNIST and CIFAR datasets.
        *   Use StyleGAN to generate photo realistic faces.

### 2.3 Flow-Based Generative Models

*    **Concept:**
    *   Flow-Based models learn a series of invertible transformations (flows) that map between a simple distribution (e.g., Gaussian) and the complex data distribution.
        *  The data is transformed through a series of invertible transformations from a simple initial distribution to a complex probability distribution that models the data.
    *   *Invertible Transformations:* Enable exact calculation of data likelihood, which is crucial for training.
*   **Key Aspects:**
    *  *Normalizing Flows:* A specific type of invertible transformation.
     * *Likelihood Maximization:* Trained to maximize the log-likelihood of the training data.

### 2.4 Transformer Networks

*   **Concept:**
      * Transformer networks are attention-based architectures that process sequential data, such as text or time series, efficiently.
       *   They are based on the attention mechanism, which allows the network to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions, instead of relying on sequential processing like recurrent models.
*   **Key Aspects:**
    *   *Attention Mechanism:* Ability to focus on relevant parts of the input.
         * Self attention, multi-head attention.
     *  *Encoder-Decoder Structure:* (can have both encoder-only or decoder-only variants)

### 2.5 Diffusion Models

*   **Concept:**
    *  Diffusion models learn to reverse a gradual noising process to generate data, going from pure noise to a sample from the data distribution.
    * The process goes through a forward diffusion process and a reverse diffusion process.
    *   *Forward Diffusion:* Gradually adds Gaussian noise to data samples until they resemble pure noise.
    *   *Reverse Diffusion:* Learns to gradually remove the noise and recover data samples from the noise.
*   **Key Aspects:**
        *   **Markov Chain:** The diffusion process is defined as a Markov chain.
         *  **Gaussian Noise:** Typically uses Gaussian noise as the noising function.
         *   **Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs):** Learn the gradient of the data distribution.
*   **Use Cases:**
        *   High-quality image generation, image editing, audio generation.
