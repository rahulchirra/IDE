Okay, I understand. You'd like the workout plan with visual aids and links to YouTube videos for proper form. This is a great way to make sure you're performing the exercises correctly.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Form Over Everything:** Watch the videos carefully and prioritize correct form. It's better to start with fewer reps and perfect your technique than to lift heavy with bad form.
*   **Variety of Sources:** I've tried to provide reputable sources, but feel free to explore other videos if you prefer.
*   **Adaptations:** Feel free to modify the exercises or reps based on your fitness level.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** Stop immediately if you experience pain.

This revised table should give you a good start to a great workout plan. Please feel free to ask if you need any further clarification.
