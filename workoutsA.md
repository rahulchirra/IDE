### **Exercise Order Logic**  
1. **Compound lifts first** (e.g., floor press, bent-over rows) for maximum strength.  
2. **Isolation exercises next** (e.g., lateral raises, reverse flyes) for muscle fatigue.  
3. **Functional finishers** (e.g., plank-to-push-up, T-rotations) for stability and endurance.  

---

### **Progression & Modifications**  
- **Chest Focus:**  
  - *Harder:* Add a 2kg rod to push-ups (place on upper back).  
  - *Easier:* Perform knee push-ups.  
- **Back Focus:**  
  - *Harder:* Slow eccentric (3-sec lowering) on rows.  
  - *Easier:* Use lighter dumbbells.  
- **Shoulders Focus:**  
  - *Harder:* Combine Arnold press with lateral raises (superset).  
  - *Easier:* Reduce range of motion on overhead presses.
